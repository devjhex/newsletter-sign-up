## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS



### What I learned

Normal CSS styles were implemented in this one but one thing I really appreciate is that when coming up with projects you'll always come to a point where you have to create your own classes and manipulate them with JavaScript and this is one thing that I didn't expect will ever need like having to use JavaScript for that part of the project no matter what but otherwise I'm officially going to tailwind now Its been a great joy learning Sass and CSS in General though.




### Continued development
I am going to continue to implement more and more projects in JavaScript as much as i can so as to be perfect in it though it can take years to do so.
